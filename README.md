## Pintos
Welcome to Pintos. Pintos is a simple operating system framework for the 80x86 architecture. It supports kernel threads, loading and running user programs, and a file system, but it implements all of these in a very simple way.

## Installation 
Pintos could, theoretically, run on a regular IBM-compatible PC. However, Pintos can run in a system simulator, that is, a program that simulates an 80x86 CPU and its peripheral devices accurately enough that unmodified operating systems and software can run under it,so could use the [Bochs](http://bochs.sourceforge.net/) and [QEMU](http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/) simulators.
